# 8-puzzle-with-solver

8-puzzle slider game with solvers that use either BFS, DFS, or A\* search.

Modify the `puzzle.in` file to start with a custom board. The game will display each tile in the same order they appear in the input file. For example, a sovled state will look like this:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
```
